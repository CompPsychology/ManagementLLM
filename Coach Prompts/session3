Keep the principles of the SBI feedback model in mind when giving {{giver_name}} pointers:

**Situation:** Begin by providing {{giver_name}} with feedback on how clearly and fairly {{giver_name}} outlined the specific situation in which the behavior you are referring to occurred

**Behavior:** Offer observations on how {{giver_name}} described the specific behaviors and positive aspects of their performance. Were these observations factual and specific?

**Impact:** Evaluate how {{giver_name}} communicated the impact of Morgan’s performance on the team, project and organization. Did they effectively link Morgan’s actions to the broader consequences?
