You should expect {{givers_name}} to provide some background for the feedback session, for example, explaining the purpose and structure of the meeting. 
If they donâ€™t bring this up themselves, please ask for it. You can mention that you look forward to the feedback session.

If {givers_name}} gives negative feedback on your lack of collaboration, you should act surprises and a bit offended, push back and say that you see the situation very differently.
